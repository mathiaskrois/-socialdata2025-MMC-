    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is done on a comprehensive dataset of European Parliament voting records. This dataset captures how each Member of the European Parliament voted on proposed legislation, along with detailed information about the legislation itself, the MEPs, and their party affiliations. The dataset includes two main file types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RCV (Roll Call Votes):** Contains individual vote records for each MEP, including their country, national party, and European Parliamentary Group (EPG).\n",
    "* **Voted Docs:** Provides metadata on the legislation being voted on, including the vote date, outcome, and associated policy area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is divided across four parliamentary sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EP6 (2004–2009)\n",
    "* EP7 (2009–2014)\n",
    "* EP8 (2014–2019)\n",
    "* EP9 (2019–2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable longitudinal analysis, we merged data from all four sessions. This required extensive preprocessing to reconcile differences in schema and formatting across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did you choose this particular dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this dataset because it offers a rich foundation for analyzing trends in European politics over time. It enables us to explore whether broader political shifts—such as increasing polarization or the rise of right-leaning ideologies—are observable in parliamentary voting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to provide users with an accessible interface to explore aggregated voting patterns and to present clear, data-driven insights into evolving political dynamics within the European Parliament. We aim to make it easy for users to identify trends related to polarization, such as which parties or policy areas are becoming more divisive, and which remain broadly supported. Ultimately, we want to support informed reflection on how shifts in ideology are shaping legislative decision-making at the EU level.\n",

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze voting trends in the European Parliament across four sessions (EP6–EP9), we consolidated roll-call vote data (`RCV`) with metadata on each legislative item (`Voted Docs`). Due to inconsistencies across sessions in schema, date formats, and naming conventions, several preprocessing steps were necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Merge EP sessions: Merged data from the 4 sessions. Were some inconsistencies in the column names so we standardized them.\n",
    "* Text Normalization: Policy area fields and party/EPG names were cleaned to remove noise (e.g., punctuation, inconsistent capitalization).\n",
    "* Date Parsing: Dates appeared in both `dd.mm.yyyy` and `yyyy-mm-dd` formats. A custom parser ensured accurate conversion to a uniform `datetime` format.\n",
    "* Schema Harmonization: Since column names and vote identifiers varied by session (e.g., `euro_act_id` in EP6 vs `Vote ID` in later sessions), we created session-aware mappings to unify data.\n",
    "* Party Group Mapping: EP political group (`EPG`) names were mapped to their common abbreviations (e.g., “Group of the European People’s Party...” → `EPP`) to allow for consistent comparison.\n",
    "* Removed incomplete years: Removed years 2004 and 2022 since they are not finished and might skew yearly results. \n",
    "* Name Standardization: MEP names were cleaned to ensure consistency across sessions, accounting for formatting, punctuation, and Unicode differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps allowed us to generate a unified dataset spanning 2005–2021 with over 27 million individual votes"

    "Our analysis of European Parliament voting patterns (2005-2022) reveals several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "- **Rice Index** ($RI = \\frac{|Y_i - N_i|}{Y_i + N_i + A_i}$) measured internal group cohesion\n",
    "- **Similarity Index** ($Sim_{1,2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(|\\%Y_1 - \\%Y_2| + |\\%N_1 - \\%N_2| + |\\%A_1 - \\%A_2|)$) quantified cross-group alignment\n",
    "- **PCA** visualized voting relationships and revealed clustering patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crisis-Driven Unity:** Major crises temporarily increase parliamentary cohesion\n",
    "   - Financial Crisis (2008): Rice index jumped from 0.5 to 0.63\n",
    "   - COVID-19 (2020): Cohesion rose to 0.54 during recovery fund votes\n",
    "   - Post-crisis periods show consistent fragmentation (index fell to 0.47 by 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Group Cohesion Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Mainstream groups (Greens/EFA, S&D, EPP) maintain high cohesion (Greens/EFA most stable: 0.04)\n",
    "   - Populist/non-attached groups show persistent fragmentation (Rice values: 0.31-0.58)\n",
    "   - Each group shows stronger unity on their core ideological issues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy-Area Insights:**\n",
    "   - **Legal Affairs:** Highest volatility across all policy domains\n",
    "   - **Employment & Environment:** Consistently below-average cohesion, reflecting ideological splits\n",
    "   - **International Trade:** Growing consensus since 2016 (particularly in 2022)\n",
    "   - **Budgetary Control:** Sharp realignment during 2012 Eurozone crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-Group Relationships:**\n",
    "   - Stable partnerships: Greens/EFA–The Left and S&D–Renew Europe\n",
    "   - Persistent opposition: IDG typically distant from other groups\n",
    "   - COVID-era divergence: Groups spread apart more dramatically after 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PCA Visualization:**\n",
    "   - Two components explain 78.3% of voting variance\n",
    "   - First component (47.1%) follows traditional left-right spectrum\n",
    "   - Crisis periods reduce inter-group distances by average 23.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis demonstrates that while European Parliament voting follows clear ideological patterns, external crises create temporary unity followed by increased fragmentation once emergencies subside."

    "A mix of interactive line charts, bar charts, and animated clustering plots was used, as each visualization plays a distinct role in the narrative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-series line charts** (e.g., Parliament-wide agreement, within-party cohesion) track longitudinal trends in internal unity and division, revealing how crises—such as the Eurozone debt crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic—produce spikes in agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy area comparisons** illustrate how polarization varies by topic. Some areas, like legal affairs, fluctuate significantly, while others, such as environment and public health, remain persistently divisive. This adds contextual nuance to the overall polarization trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactive bar charts** provide drill-down views of individual party behavior across topics, allowing users to explore how ideological agendas shape cohesion on specific issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clustering plots**, based on custom similarity indices, visualize inter-group alignment. These go beyond simple metrics to reveal how close or distant different parties are in their voting behavior. The spatial arrangements offer an intuitive way to communicate abstract political distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tables** are used to complement the clustering plots by providing a clear overview of the most extreme differences or similarities—insights that could otherwise be easy to overlook.\n"
