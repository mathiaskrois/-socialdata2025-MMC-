    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected a comprehensive dataset of European Parliament voting records. This dataset captures how each Member of the European Parliament (MEP) voted on proposed legislation, along with detailed information about the legislation itself, the MEPs, and their party affiliations. The dataset includes two main file types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RCV (Roll Call Votes):** Contains individual vote records for each MEP, including their country, national party, and European Parliamentary Group (EPG).\n",
    "* **Voted Docs:** Provides metadata on the legislation being voted on, including the vote date, outcome, and associated policy area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is divided across four parliamentary sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EP6 (2004–2009)\n",
    "* EP7 (2009–2014)\n",
    "* EP8 (2014–2019)\n",
    "* EP9 (2019–2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable longitudinal analysis, we merged data from all four sessions. This required extensive preprocessing to reconcile differences in schema and formatting across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did you choose this particular dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this dataset because it offers a rich foundation for analyzing trends in European politics over time. It enables us to explore whether broader political shifts—such as increasing polarization or the rise of right-leaning ideologies—are observable in parliamentary voting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to provide users with an accessible interface to explore aggregated voting patterns and to present clear, data-driven insights into evolving political dynamics within the European Parliament. We aim to make it easy for users to identify trends related to polarization, such as which parties or policy areas are becoming more divisive, and which remain broadly supported. Ultimately, we want to support informed reflection on how shifts in ideology are shaping legislative decision-making at the EU level.\n",

    "# Basic Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze voting trends in the European Parliament across four sessions (EP6–EP9), we consolidated roll-call vote data (`RCV`) with metadata on each legislative item (`Voted Docs`). Due to inconsistencies across sessions in schema, date formats, and naming conventions, several preprocessing steps were necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Name Standardization:** MEP names were cleaned to ensure consistency across sessions, accounting for formatting, punctuation, and Unicode differences.\n",
    "* **Text Normalization:** Policy area fields and party/EPG names were cleaned to remove noise (e.g., punctuation, inconsistent capitalization).\n",
    "* **Date Parsing:** Dates appeared in both `dd.mm.yyyy` and `yyyy-mm-dd` formats. A custom parser ensured accurate conversion to a uniform `datetime` format.\n",
    "* **Schema Harmonization:** Since column names and vote identifiers varied by session (e.g., `euro_act_id` in EP6 vs `Vote ID` in later sessions), we created session-aware mappings to unify data.\n",
    "* **Party Group Mapping:** EP political group (`EPG`) names were mapped to their common abbreviations (e.g., “Group of the European People’s Party...” → `EPP`) to allow for consistent comparison.\n",
    "* **Missing Values:** Non-informative entries (e.g., empty vote fields or unknown policy areas) were filtered or imputed based on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps allowed us to generate a unified dataset spanning 2004–2022 with over **4.8 million individual votes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations from the cleaned data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📅 **Time Coverage:** The dataset spans four European Parliament terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * EP6: 2004–2009\n",
    "  * EP7: 2009–2014\n",
    "  * EP8: 2014–2019\n",
    "  * EP9: 2019–2022\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **MEPs Involved:** \\~1,300 unique MEPs from all 27 EU member states.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📄 **Votes Recorded:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \\~26,000 roll-call votes\n",
    "  * \\~4.8 million MEP-level voting entries (rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🗳️ **Vote Distribution (Sample):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  | Vote      | Meaning                    | % of Total     |\n",
    "  | --------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |\n",
    "  | 1         | For                        | \\~48%          |\n",

    "  | 3         | Abstain                    | \\~12%          |\n",
    "  | 4 / 5 / 6 | Absent / No vote / Excused | \\~13% combined |\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🏛️ **Top Policy Areas:** After cleaning and consolidating, common topics included:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Environment\n",
    "  * Budget and financial affairs\n",
    "  * Foreign relations\n",
    "  * Digital and industry regulation\n",
    "  * Civil rights and rule of law\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧭 **EP Group Participation:** Most votes came from major groups like `EPP`, `S&D`, `Renew`, `ID`, `Greens/EFA`, and `The Left`.\n",
